### What is Alternative Data?
Alternative data draws from non-traditional data sources. Fundamental data relies on intrinsic factors such as revenue and earnings, and technical data simply uses price history. Alternative data can be from social media, satellite images, GPS data, etc.

### What is Technical Data?
Technical data is based solely on the price history of the stock. Each indicator is suited to different styles of trading.
* Trend
* Momentum
* Volatility
* Dollar Volume

### Trading Mantra
* Control Your Emotions - The most difficult thing about trading and investing is handling your emotions when decision-making. The worst thing you could do is enter a position solely based on emotion, for example, jumping into Bitcoin during its moon launch to $20,000 so that you don't get FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Being able to stay balanced mentally will allow you to think more rationally and become a better trader.
* Be Prepared to Lose Sometimes - Nobody wins 100% of the time, not even me. I've lost over $1000 in a single trading day, but the worst part wasn't losing the money, it was the negative after-effects it had on my mental health. Once I traded enough, I began to realize that I wasn't going to win all the time and that the best thing I could do after a loss is to prepare myself even better for the next trade.
* Exercise and Eat Healthy - Having a healthy diet and exercising improves how your brain functions allowing you to think more intelligently and rationally. Getting enough sleep is also crucial, especially if you're on the west coast when the market opens at 6:30AM. Just being healthy in general is good for the longevity and happiness of your overall life.
* Take a Break - Trading is like a marathon. You don't want to go all-in on the first lap and risk getting knocked out completely. Pace yourself mentally and physically. Have a hobby that isn't related to the stock market and is mentally challenging (not scrolling through Facebook/Instagram or watching hours of Netflix). For me, it's playing guitar and singing, or exploring the city I am in.
* Do Good Things - Make an effort to help others whenever you can, whether it's donating, volunteering, or simply complimenting somebody. Having a positive mental mindset goes a long way and the attitude you have towards others will translate to the attitude you have around trading. I strive to separate from the stigma of Wall Street that all they care about is themselves and how much money they make.
Family, friends, and health are more important than money.
